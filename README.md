# Aristotle Labs Challenge
A challenge that will test the true worth and knowledge of those who dare fork this repo.

## Instructions
Create a web app that will test the site speed of a given URL.  The web app should show the user the time to first byte, speed index, and page size for the URL.  Also, it should show the user how they rank for SEO (pass or fail) in terms of if their page title is within the suggested number of characters, the meta description meets best practices, and that there is only one h1 tag on the page.

## Rules
- Use whatever language you need to get the job done.
- The UI should be simple and clear for the user to understand the metrics shown.
- Don't use a CSS grid framework.  Use CSS.
- Should be viewable in evergreen browsers.
- Code with the idea that this will be used later and will have new features added.
- At least 1 Unit tests should be included.
- At least 1 Integration tests should be included.
- Demonstrate a build process that at least minifies your assets.

## What we are looking for
- How easy it for others to take what you have and extend it / add new features
- How easy it is for others to refactor code
- Is the code easy to read and understand

## When is this due
- Submit your answers via a pull request or if you prefer to not make your answer public then you can email it to us.
- We will not take any submissions after Sunday, July 9
